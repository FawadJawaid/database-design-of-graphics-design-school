## PROJECT NAME
DATABASE OF GRAPHICS DESIGN SCHOOL

## PROJECT DESCRIPTION
We are designing the database for the Graphics Design School and we are naming that school as ‘Nexus’. The instructors that work at Nexus have a variety of expertise and experience the surrounding area. One of them will be the founders and partners of the school. When an instructor is hired, his/her address and phone number, SIN, date of birth, experience and expertise and email address is collected and a staff number is assigned.
Students register for instruction online and are required to include similar information as well as payment information for tuition and their choice of courses. The course overviews are available online and include the name of the course, any prerequisites or required experience, a description of the course and its assignments, the time frame in which it is offered and the name of the associated instructor.
Once registration is close, the instructor receives the list of students and begins email correspondence. Course material is emailed to the students and lectures are conducted by teleconference. All assignments are scanned that is photographs, drawings and emailed or otherwise sent electronically that is with the provision of a website. Evaluations are returned to the students. The addition of the new student design project and market will require a release form from interested students for display purposes.
The database will create a centralized system for the instructors, students, graphic design projects, evaluations for viewing by the instructors and the concerned student only, the courses and the course material.
